My name is Ashton Ribett and I tried to recreate Space Invaders. I wanted to create Space Invaders because it is a very popular game and it seemend like it would be simple enough to create.

I used my previous class recordings as well as using W3schools and ChatGPT to help fix my errors. 

Most of my challenges that I encountered throughout making this game was ordering my code correclty, but also collison and the bullets. A very hard issue to figure out was why the game would end whenever it hit a blocker.

The player has three lives and is limited to having five bullets on the screen at once. When the player loses their three lives or they kill all 50 alies, the game will end with either a victory or a defeat popup as well as an option to reset the game. 

I used a little bit of HTML and CSS, but almost all of the code is written in JavaScript.
